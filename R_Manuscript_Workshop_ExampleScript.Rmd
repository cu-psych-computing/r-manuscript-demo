# Notes on the Analysis File
- There are many advantages to putting your code into a .Rmd file instead of a .R file. For manuscripts, I find this is especially useful because I end up with a nice, rendered html file that contains both my code and my output. It makes it easier for me to check my results/code against the inline stats reported in my manuscript. I think  this also facilitates sharing/posting code to accompany your manuscript, as you can more easily annotate the code and provide a knitted version that is accessible to those who may not be R users. 

- But, there are also some caveats/issues to be aware of:
1) Caching doesn't really work in the usual way when sourcing from an Rmarkdown file. As in, the cache == T statement won't help, because the ksource function that we use to source from an Rmarkdown file doesn't recognize cache == T. If you have big models or stuff that takes a long time to run, it's probably a good idea to find a work-around so that you aren't having to run that from scratch everytime you want to source your Rmarkdown file. I show some examples of how to make this easier below, by saving brms model objects as .rds files and then reading those in rather than rerunning them.

2) Related to caching and knitting, in your papaja (or other) file with your manuscript, only changes to code will be recognized if you are using cached code chunks. Say for exmample that you want to cache your chunk (in the manuscript file) that contains the sourcing of your Rmarkdown file. Even if you completely change the *contents* of your Rmarkdown file, those changes will NOT be reflected in your manuscript if you have cached the chunk that sources from that Rmarkdown file. Why? Because as far as the Rmarkdown manuscript file is concerned, that code chunk looks identical to before. In other words, it doesn't "know" that you made changes within the to-be-sourced file itself. 

```{r}
source("R_Manuscript_Workshop_ExampleSetUp.R")
```

# Subset Data
```{r}
# for simplicity, we will only look at data from the first time point
mydata <- subset(bmlm::BLch9, time == 1)
```

# Model 1
```{r model1, cache = T, eval = F}
model1 <- brm(m ~ x, data = mydata)
saveRDS(model1, "model1.rds")
```

```{r}
model1 <- readRDS("model1.rds")
summary(model1)
```


# Model 2
```{r model2, cache = T, eval = F}
model2 <- brm(y ~ x, data = mydata)
saveRDS(model2, "model2.rds")
```
```{r}
model2 <- readRDS("model2.rds")
summary(model2)
```

# Summary Table of Results
```{r}
dv1 <- blm_table(model1)
dv2 <- blm_table(model2)

resultsummary <- rbind(dv1, dv2)
resultsummary

```
