# Introduction
  Much research has investigated how invisible support relative to visible support benefits recipients [@Bolger2000; @Bolger2007; @Howland2010a]. In one noteworthy investigation, Girme and colleagues [-@Girme2013] showed that invisible support predicts benefits to goal pursuit over time.
  
# Study 1
  Study 1 aimed to test our hypothesis. 

## Method
  We downloaded some data from the internet. It was a study of individuals in a romantic relationship. 
  
## Results
  First, we examined the effect of x on m. Contrary to our predictions, we found no main effect of x on m, `r txt(model1, "x")`. However, we did find a main effect of x on y, `r txt(model2, "x")`.

# Discussion
  These findings have many important implications.
